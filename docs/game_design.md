# Monster Pinball

![logo](./docs/logo.png)


## Concept
Monster Pinball is an innovative mobile game that combines the classic mechanics of pinball with monster collecting, RPG elements, and themed environments. Players navigate pinballs through various elemental realms, hatching and collecting unique monsters while experiencing dynamic, evolving pinball tables.

## Core Mechanics

### 1. Pinball Basics
- Traditional flipper controls
- Tilt functions themed to each realm (e.g., "Gust Shield" in Sky Citadel)
- Multiple themed tables representing different elemental realms

### 2. Monster Hatching Mechanic
1. **Activation Phase:**
   - 5 random targets appear on the table, indicated by glowing arrows
   - Targets can be bumpers, switches, ramps, or other pinball elements
   - Player must hit all 5 in any order

2. **Egg Spawn:**
   - An egg appears in the center of the table
   - Egg's appearance hints at the monster's rarity and type

3. **Egg Rarity System:**
   - Common: 3 hits required (green dots)
   - Uncommon: 4 hits required (blue dots)
   - Rare: 5 hits required (purple dots)

4. **Hatching Phase:**
   - Player hits the egg the required number of times
   - Each hit visibly cracks the egg
   - Optional timer for added urgency

5. **Monster Reveal:**
   - Egg breaks open with a flashy animation
   - Monster appears on the table and is added to the player's collection

### 3. Pinball Upgrades
- Normal Ball (1x Multiplier)
- Elemental Ball (2x Multiplier, changes based on realm)
- Monstrous Ball (3x Multiplier, takes on characteristics of caught monsters)
- Legendary Ball (5x Multiplier, rare and powerful)

## Core Game Loop

### 3. Hatching and Power-up
- Focus on hatching the egg by hitting it the required number of times

### 4. Elemental Combos
- Encourage hitting targets that match the current monster's element
- Building combos leads to "evolution energy" for monsters

- Each monster ball has unique properties based on its type

### 7. Realm Mastery
